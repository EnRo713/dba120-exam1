## For ch5_ex5.sql:
# Assuming the invoice_id generated by MySQL for the invoice added in the previous question is 1, this statement is inserting two rows into the invoice_line_items table.

## For ch5_ex8.sql:
# This statement uses a subquery to first find the vendor IDs for vendors with a default_terms_id of 2, and then updates the terms_id column in the Invoices table for all invoices that have a matching vendor_id.

## For ch5_ex9.sql:
# The first statement deletes all rows from the invoice_line_items table where the invoice_id matches the maximum invoice_id in the invoices table (which should be the row we just added). The second statement deletes the row from the invoices table with the same maximum invoice_id. The use of MAX(invoice_id) is to ensure that we're only deleting the row we just added, even if there are other rows in the invoices table with higher invoice_id values.
